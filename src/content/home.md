### About me

I'm a frontend developer based in Milan. Mah.. I really do not know what a frontend developer is in 2019, 
I can say that I enjoy using the technologies of the previous paragraph and that every day I discover new things.
I've been working for [Bitbull](https://www.bitbull.it/) for 5 years, that is from its foundation.

### Open source

I use a lot of instruments developed by other people,
so I also try in my own little way to share some of the things I do.
I made two tools in php for Final Cut users: [Fast Titles](http://www.ilgattohanuovecode.it/tool/final-cut-fast-titles/) 
and [Final cut to motion](http://www.ilgattohanuovecode.it/tool/final-cut-round-trip/). Some modules for Magento, for example the [newsletter popup](https://github.com/bitbull-team/magento2-module-newsletterpopup), the [Instagram widget](https://github.com/bitbull-team/magento2-module-instagramwidget) 
and a [gulpfile](https://github.com/bitbull-team/magento2-gulpfile) in order to try to speed up the compilation of the less on Magento2. 

I also contribute to [Vue Storefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront), a very cool Open Source project with a large community and a lot of contributors around the world.
